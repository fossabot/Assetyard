# Assetyard 

Assetyard is cross-platform desktop Content Pipeline for game projects.

## What is the Content Pipeline?

[Games from Within](http://gamesfromwithin.com/optimizing-the-content-pipeline) describes the Content Pipeline as 
> ... the path that all the game assets follow, from conception until they can be loaded in the game. Game assets include everything that is not code: models, textures, materials, sounds, animations, cinematics, scripts, etc. During their trip through the pipeline, assets might be converted, optimized, chopped to bits, or combined. In the end, the asset is in a format that will be shipped with the final version of the game.

[Xamarin](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/game_development/cocossharp/content_pipeline/introduction/) describes the Content Pipeline as
> ... a general term for the process of converting a file from one format to another. The input of the content pipeline is typically a file outputted by an authoring tool, such as image files from Photoshop. The content pipeline creates the output file in a format that can be loaded directly by a game project. Typically the output files are optimized for fast loading and reduced disk size.

## Why use a Content Pipeline?
